# compiler
`npm install -g typescript` to install this globally
`tsc init` to init this folder for compiler (this will create special file which will reprecent settings of compilation in this repository)

## tsconfig.json
"target" if for versions of javascript


# type annotation
is `let myAwesomeString :string = "Cheesecake";`

`let myAwesomeString!: string;`, symbol `!` allows me to avoid typescript error "variablename are used before being assigned"
